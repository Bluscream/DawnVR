 -- Important Looking Classes --
T_1005C221 - contains settings info
	- subclass T_542F8CA7 - contains some kind of controls

T_12B4FFCA - seems to contain ui scripting

T_C811E0CD::404 - tutorial text

T_64B68373.eCurrentEpisode - current episode enum

T_C3DD66D9 - hopefully contains the player controller
	- line 735 - getting player movement axis

T_A6E913D1 - data manager of some sort (non-obfucasted class name is "GameMaster")
	- static var Instance.m_gameModeManager.CurrentMode - basic idea of where the player is
	- static var Instance.m_inputManager.GetInputState - gets if a certain input was just pushed down or is being held

T_C3DD66D9 - controls player movement and the camera - possibly use this to disable animations?
 - m_animStates
   - can disable idling by changing the time and weight variables of kIdle (index 0 it seems) to 0

T_884A92DB - actually controls the camera movement
	- var _1D9C76B26 - has the actual camera component

T_34182F31 - static class with some Camera variables
	- static var MainUICamera - assumingly finds the NGUI camera? (needs more research)
	- static var main - returns MainUICamera

T_F8FE3E1C - inherits a few classes but ends up being a MonoBehaviour, seems to control the phone (or burner, as the code says)

T_6FCAE66C - InputManager

--- Hotspot Object Class Info ---
T_6FD30C1C - selectable objects (unob name "ST_Hotspot")
T_244D769F - (unob name  "HotspotObject")
T_E6DAC959 - (unob name  "ST_Tag")

T_572A4969 - ("InteractUI") handles displaying the pointer and text for each Hotspot
T_F8FE3E1C - ("FreeRoamWindow") handles displaying the outline and contains the InteractUI

--- Main LISCamera Component Mapping ---
UnityStandardAssets._1CC59503E.T_53A129E6 - UnityStandardAssets.ImageEffects.SunShafts
T_ACB76229 - LISDeferredSetup
T_4D93A7F7 - SlaveCamera
T_4679B25C - HighlightManager
T_9D242C27 - CameraMovement
_167702734.T_7ACC9EC4 - IdolDebug.ScreenshotUtils
UnityEngine._1F1547F66.T_190FC323 - UnityEngine.PostProcessing.PostProcessingBehaviour
T_209ED6B6 - FreeroamCharacterFillLight

 -- Method Info --
ExtendedViewBase.GrabExtendedView<T>(Camera, Camera, T) - updates the cached camera and then returns the component T and adds it to the object, if needed (T seems to nearly always be ExtendedViewThirdPerson and ExtendedViewFirstPerson)

 -- Just Things I've Learned From Testing --
 T_A6E913D1.Instance.m_mainCharacter becomes null during any cutscene, even if it's super simple like when Chloe is clearing out her locker (still exists, just not set in the datamanager)
 Nearly all UI elements (loading screens n such) are in the main scene "StoryTellerMain"
