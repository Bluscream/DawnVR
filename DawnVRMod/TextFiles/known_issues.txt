 - player height is never taken into account
 - as alec noted from his playtests, when spinning in a circle you can gain some slight speed (with the new movement system)
 - when loading into a scene there may be a wait before the player can move, i haven't been able to track down why this occurs
 - some parts of the interaction ui may get hidden behind objects, a good example being one of the stickers in the Parking Lot scene
